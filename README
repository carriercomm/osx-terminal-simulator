This Terminal emulator in applescript allows the user to run custom shell
commands without needing shell access. This can be useful, as by default,
a system administrator might disable shell access as well as executing 
code not in /Applications. If that's the case, then this applescript
can be used to bypass that (as Script Editor is in /Applications) and 
execute command line code.
